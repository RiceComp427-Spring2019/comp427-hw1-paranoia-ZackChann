## Problem 1
- Scenario: G20
- Assumptions:
  - some people may try to trespass to pose threats.
- Assets:
   - presidents (or prime ministers, chancellors).
   - other people attending the summit
   - some important documents that may present in the summit
- Threats:
  - terrorists may plan to attack the summit to create panic and chaos. There are several ways they may attack the summit. They may set up bombs around the place, bring weapons into or around the place and shoot randomly on people or try to poison the food 
  - some people may want to hurt attendee, because they are disappointed with him.
  - some people may just be crazy and want to hurt someone in front of many people.
  - spies may want to get access to some important documents.
- Countermeasures:
  - set up cameras that cover every corner of the place, and hire some people to watch the CCTV and patrol around the place. This may need a lot of money to hire professional security guards, but this helps prevent lots of threats.
  - hire people to oversee food preparing, food making and every procedure. This may need a lot of money to hire professional security guards, but this helps prevent lots of threats.
  - security check for all people entering the place. This may slow the speed of people entering the place. But it can prevent weapons from entering the place.
  - use some well-trained police dog to keep searching the place and around the place for bombs or any other hazardous stuffs.

## Problem 2

  - some terrorists may get into the airport or even the plane.
  - the food on the plane may be poisoned.
  - explosive or flammable stuffs on the plane,
- Countermeasures:
  - use scanner to scan carry-on luggage and checked luggage for any hazardous stuffs. If there is, inform the passenger to take it out. Otherwise, that piece of luggage should not be on the plane. It costs lot of money and passenger's time, but it can prevent hazardous stuffs and weapons to be onboard, which vastly reduces threats.
  - train stuff to be cautious on every process of preparing foods, to prevent any possible of the food getting poisoned. Also, secure surveillance cameras should be set up to monitor the working area to ensure there are nothing abnormal happened. If any abnormal things happened, that batch of food should be aboard under security consideration.
